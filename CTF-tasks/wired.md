 1) **Ceasercipher**
    just copied the text and pasted it on ceaser cipher decode fr.
    it just decrypted and gave the decoded text.
    i learned how to decrypt ceaser cypher code
 2) **da_french_cipher**
    copied the text , then used vinegre cipher decoder 
    used vowels as the key.
    i learned how to decode french cipher with  a given key.
 3) **Lifetimesettlement**
    copied the text given and went to cipher check.
    then pasted the text  copied. it gave that it can be decrypted with spoon.
    so then i selected spoon and decrypted the text. i learned that when something is written in 0s and 1s all of them are not binary !.
    
 4) **Î¼Py_flag**
    The task was to obtain the key from the given arduino module.i was having no idea how to read data from module using serial monitor. So abhijeeth bro helped me in that.
    so i connected it to the port and selected the board and opened serial monitor. then changed the boadrate until a human redable text appeared.
    then i typed print(flag)
    this printed a encrypted key. so i opended decode cypher and analyzed the encryption then got the flag after decrypting it
    i learned how to use serial monitor to communicate with arduino
    
 5) **find_thyself**
    this was a easy task. i opened the photo and found the name in it.
    then open google and searched for the name , it was a company in Italy , so i used Italy a flag.
    
 6) **ain't_no_sunshine!**
    i created the circuit as given in the circuit diagram , then connected it to the 
    port , when sunlight fall on it , then in the serial monitor i got the flag.
    
 7) **chan's favorite**
    first i downloaded the wav file.
    then used audacity to get the spectrogram
    the image was of the rick rolls guy
    so used his name as key
    
 8) **~logic**
    in the website first i tried different logic patters. then i finally got the correct one.
    then i got the key.
    
 9) **D0Z3N_IS_K3Y**
    i downloaded the corrupted file then used decrypt  cypher, then brute forced the file and used the 12th encrypted key as the flag
    
 10) **grep_it**
    downloaded the file and i used find to find the flag
    
 11) **L3D_Tr4c3R**
    i used the given components to build a circuit from internet
    then uploaded the code and run it.
    
 12) **WiFi_Hacking-1**
    first i didnt knew how to do this, but i got a video of david bomball from the youtube how to hack a wifi using monitor mode enabled in wifi adapter
    so i did all the commands he did in my booted kali
    so i got the password.
